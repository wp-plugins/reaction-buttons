Requires at least: 2.9.1
Tested up to: 2.9.1
Stable tag: 0.9

Adds Buttons for very simple and fast feedback to your post. Inspired by Blogger.

== Description ==

This addon adds buttons below your posts to make it easy to get reactions to the post, but without the hassle of writing a whole comment. It makes it easier for the reader to interact with you. The buttons are configurable (how many, what text) and simply are counters to how often they were clicked.

The idea is inspired by a [blogger feature](http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/2008/08/new-feature-reactions.html) and since it's been my first addon, I borrowed the structure from [sociable](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sociable/).

== Installation ==

Nothing fancy, just like any wordpress addon:

1. Upload and unzip the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Optionally configure the plugin in the settings tab
