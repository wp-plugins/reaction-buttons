=== Reaction Buttons ===
Tags: feedback, polls, button, comment
Requires at least: 2.9.1
Tested up to: 2.9.2
Stable tag: 0.9.9

Adds Buttons for very simple and fast feedback to your post. Inspired by Blogger.

== Description ==

This addon adds buttons below your posts (or somewhere else) to make it easy to get reactions to the post, but without the hassle of writing a whole comment. It makes it easier for the reader to interact with you. The buttons are configurable (how many, what text, position) and simply are counters to how often they were clicked. There is also a widget and a shortcode to show the top x posts with the most clicks for each button.

The idea is inspired by a [blogger feature](http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/2008/08/new-feature-reactions.html) and since it's been my first addon, I borrowed the structure from [sociable](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sociable/).

== Installation ==

Nothing fancy, just like any wordpress addon:

1. Upload and unzip the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Optionally configure the plugin in the settings tab

You can also use the widget to show the top x posts with the most clicks for each button in your sidebar. Or alternatively you can use the shortcode [reaction_buttons_most_clicks] to insert the same information somewhere in your post. (Takes limit_posts as argument to set up how many posts per button should be shown: Default: [reaction_buttons_most_clicks limit_posts=3])

= Did I get any questions so far? =

== Restrictions ==
* There cannot be spaces in html classes, so the plugin wouldn't work if there would be buttons named "great article" *and* "great___article", because it converts the spaces into three underscores.
* Also the addon (at least the ajax part) doesn't work with certain special chars like exclamation marks. If thats a problem for someone I can see if there is a way to fix it, for now I'm all right with it. :)
